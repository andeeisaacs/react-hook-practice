                There once was a {nounOne}, who lived on {nounTwo}.

                {nounOne} loved to {verbOne} all day long.

            <p>
                but the people of {nounTwo} really didnt like that {nounOne} was so {adjOne}.
            </p>
            <p> 
                So they hired {nounThree} who was {adjTwo} and could {verbTwo} to scare {nounOne} away!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, {nounOne} moved away to {nounFour}.
